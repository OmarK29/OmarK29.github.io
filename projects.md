## Vanderbilt IEEE Project Showcase (Founded & Hosted)
**Founder & Lead Organizer — 2025**

- Founded and hosted the **first-ever Vanderbilt IEEE Project Showcase**
- Created a platform for students to present technical projects using
  **university lab resources that had historically been underutilized**
- Enabled students to gain **hands-on, resume-relevant engineering experience**
  beyond coursework
- Coordinated logistics, technical requirements, judging criteria, and outreach
  across multiple engineering disciplines
- Established a repeatable framework for future showcases, lowering the barrier
  for student-led technical projects

**Impact**
- Increased student engagement with labs, tools, and fabrication resources
- Shifted IEEE’s role from passive programming to **active technical enablement**
- Provided students with tangible project outcomes and presentation experience

**Skills:** technical leadership, systems thinking, stakeholder coordination,
resource enablement, engineering education
